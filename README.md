Installation Instructions
-
1. Download and unzip the latest version of AmongMods.zip by right clicking the zip file and selecting *Extract Here*.
2. Other than remembering where you downloaded the launcher to, that's literally it.
3. Run the AmongMods.exe executable in the unzipped file to access the launcher.
4. If you really want to, right click on the AmongMods.exe file and select *Create Shortcut* which you can then place anywhere on your system.

## Create a new mod folder
1. Go to the *File* tab in the top left of the launcher and select *New Mod*.
2. Type in a name for this new mod and click on *Submit*.
3. This \*should* refresh the AmongMods launcher and open the new mod file location in File Explorer. However due to a current bug this may not always happen, in which case you'll need to go back to the *File* tab to refresh the launcher and also click on *Browse Local Files* to get to the the mods folder.
4. From there you can install any Among Us mod you'd like to that new mod folder by following the necessary instructions that the mod maker provides.
