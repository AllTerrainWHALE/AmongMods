Installation Instruction
- 
1. Go to your Among Us local files ( Right Click on Among Us -> Manage -> Browse Local Files ), and from there click on the 'common' folder on the directory bar at the top
2. In that folder create a new folder. This can be named whatever you want and it will hold the AmongMods Launcher and Mods folder.
3. Download the latest release and unzip the .zip file in the folder you create in step 2.
4. Go into the folder that was unzipped which will be called 'AmongMods' + the version you installed ( e.g 'AmongMods-v1.0' ) and launch the .exe file that should be named the exact same as the folder you are in, and it will have an icon of a green Among Us character on a blue background.
5. You will only have to launch the program once from the way in step 4 each time you download a new version, as there is now a 'Mods' folder and 'AmongMods' shortcut in the folder you created in step 2. You can now use that 'AmongMods' shortcut to launch the game each time you launch the program, and for ease of access you can make a shortcut on you desktop for it or add it to your Start Menu or Taskbar.
